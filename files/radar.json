    "description": "Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before the code. It follows a red-green-refactor cycle: write a failing test, make it pass, then improve the code. TDD helps ensure code quality, maintainability, and provides built-in documentation through tests. Ideal for complex business logic and critical systems."

It emphasizes defining clear interfaces between systems upfront, enabling parallel development, better integration, and consistent user experience. This approach is particularly valuable for microservices architectures, distributed teams, and applications requiring multiple client implementations."

This approach emphasizes the importance of documenting and versioning API collections, enabling better collaboration, testing, and integration across teams. It enhances API discoverability and ensures that all stakeholders have access to up-to-date API information."

While they offer privacy benefits, they often provide lower quality results compared to cloud alternatives due to hardware limitations. Running these models locally requires significant computational resources, potentially impacting development performance. Cloud-based solutions currently offer better reliability and quality while being more resource-efficient."
